# BIBDA_park_PS4_project
Hello, my name is Pasquale and I am an aspirant data scientist. I am new to GitHub and coding with Python.
This repository was created to host files and coding for personal project work in the Master BIBDA 

The project goal was to retrieve data from the playstationstore website and setting a goal in the use of this data.

#What  goal did I give to myself?

I supposed to be a data scientist from an amusement park and my manager asked me to give some insights on what could be the best game to choose for the opening of a GAMING area in the Park.
I downloaded some data from PS store using a scraper and made some data analysis using SQL and Python and Data Visualization throught TABLEAU. Moreover I created a minimal GUI to interact with park clients to have fun.
